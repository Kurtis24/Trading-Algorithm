# Trading Algorithm

## Overview

This project is an automated trading system designed to manage funds by executing trades and generating passive income. Developed as a passion project, it helped me explore ways to build a personal investment portfolio. Additionally, it provided valuable insights into algorithm design and functionality.

## How It Works

The algorithm identifies the best-fit line on a given graph, enabling the bot to make informed decisions about buying or selling. By leveraging backtesting tools such as Alpaca and Lumibot, I visualized the bot's performance. Integrating API keys allowed me to create an algorithm that operates with paper money, simulating real-time trading scenarios to evaluate its effectiveness.

## Current Development

I am working on incorporating a web scraping feature that processes news and articles based on predefined inputs. This enhancement aims to enable the bot to adjust its trading bias dynamically by analyzing and learning from the information it gathers. Furthermore, I plan to refine the algorithm, as its current version is too simplistic for my objectives.
